# virtual_alloc
A small prototype project to implement unity’s pool class to my game project. This is a low-level c++20 memory that introduces an extra type safe.  I made some minor changes to this class in my game project, I added a linked list on the top of this. I didn’t see much documentation about virtual allocation, so I decided to write my own.
